# Service_request_management_system

In this project, I have built REST APIs to demonstrate CRUD operations with the application of Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB and Vanilla JS and finally deployed the app on Heroku.

 - I have used MongoDB as my primary database. It is a NoSQL database which, unlike the traditional row/column model, stores the data in JSON format. 
 - Node.js is a server-side JavaScript run-time environment. It is used for traditional web sites and back-end API services. I have used Node.js for our APIs which were created for performing CRUD operations i.e through POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively.
 - Dependencies: The following modules have also been used;
     - Express: Express is Node.js web application framework which Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
     - Cors: CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable people using a website to interact with different web APIâ€™s.
     - Mongoose: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to define the schemas so unneeded data is not stored in database.
     - body-parser: This is a node.js middleware for handling JSON, Raw, Text and URL encoded form data. 
 - Finally I have used Heroku for deploying the app. Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
